    description: "PROPTIMus is a web-based application that allows for the local optimisation of protein structures predicted by the AlphaFold2 algorithm and deposited in the AlphaFoldDB database. Users can upload their own protein structures in PDB format, and the application will perform local optimisation using state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations. The results are then visualised in an interactive 3D viewer, allowing users to explore the optimised structures and compare them with the original predictions.",

    description: "PROPTIMus is a web application for the local optimisation of protein structures predicted by the AlphaFold2 algorithm and deposited in the AlphaFoldDB database. Protein regions predicted with confidence less than 90 are optimized by the physics-based generic force field GFN-FF accelerated by a divide-and-conquer approach which results are comparable to the optimisation of whole protein structure with constrained α-carbons. Thus, FFFold optimises in particular the bond lengths and angles and describes the interactions between nearby residues. Before computation of the charges, input protein structures are protonated by PROPKA3. The details about the methodology and usage are described in the manual.
